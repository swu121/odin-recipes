        <li>
            Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter
            in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white
            sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature
            and let simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
            slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the 
            sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that
            it does not run off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature
            to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45
            minutes, until apples are soft.
